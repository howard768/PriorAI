## üìä **Demo Scenarios**

We've included three pre-built test cases that showcase different approval scenarios:

### **üü¢ High Probability Case (85%+ approval)**
- **Patient:** 52-year-old male, BMI 32.5, HbA1c 8.2
- **History:** Multiple treatment failures, cardiovascular comorbidities
- **Payer:** UnitedHealthcare
- **Expected:** High approval probability, minimal suggestions

### **üü° Medium Probability Case (60-70% approval)**
- **Patient:** 38-year-old female, BMI 28.5, HbA1c 7.1
- **History:** Recently diagnosed, limited treatment trials
- **Payer:** Anthem
- **Expected:** Medium approval probability, some optimization suggestions

### **üî¥ Challenging Case (40-50% approval)**
- **Patient:** 35-year-old male, BMI 26.0, HbA1c 6.8
- **History:** Young patient, borderline control, minimal treatment history
- **Payer:** Aetna
- **Expected:** Lower approval probability, multiple improvement suggestions
